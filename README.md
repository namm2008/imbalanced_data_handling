### Introduction:
Nowadays, the problems related to financial fraud increase day by day around the world. In UK only, it is 190 billion pounds of lost money per annum. A variety of solutions to such kind of issue were implemented by vast number of banks recent years, however the fraudulence still affects a significant part of clients creating a strong erosion of confidence in banks and undermining their credibility. Money fraudulence continues to gain momentum which includes issues of plastic cards theft, breaking online-banking profiles, stealing personal information, account numbers and security codes. Thus, the actions to minimize money theft issues were undertaken but there is still an urgent need of more considerate work on finding better and stronger system to keep financial information private and difficult to hack. The implementation of AI into banking security system had already been started. Therefore, following Teradataâ€™s success in determination of fraud schemes by their learning machines, it is important to review different AI tools for better and more accurate outcome in this regard.
